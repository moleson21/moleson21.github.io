# About Me
Hello! My name is Mitchell and I am a UC Berkeley graduate who majored in Mechanical Engineer and Electrical Engineering & Computer Science. I am extremely passionate about hardware systems and the software that supports them. Throughout my professional work and in the clubs/classes at Berkeley, I have utilized my multi-disciplinary skillset to develop advanced solutions to challenging problems. I enjoy tinkering with hardware to create efficient and cost effective solutions in addition to writing my own embedded software to further optimize space and speed constraints.

Outside of school & work, I thoroughly enjoy camping and have achieved the Eagle Scout rank in the [Boy Scouts of America](https://www.scouting.org/). Most recently, I traveled for three weeks up the US-101 along the California and Oregon coast then back down through Crater Lake and Lassen National Parks.


# Professional experience
See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchell-oleson-42381a101/) for more detailed and up to date information. In short, I have previously worked for:

- SpaceX:
  Spent two summers (once as a Launch Intern and another as an Associate Engineer) at the SpaceX Vandenberg launch site. During both of these experiences, I was involved wtih ground side command & control deployment, camera installation/configuration/control, system management, sensor troubleshooting, and camera control software creation.

- Intel:
  Spent a summer as a technical intern benchmarking their new Optane Memory solutions using SYSMark 2014, PCMark Vantage/8, 3DMark, and IOMeter across numerous system configurations. Additionally, I authored a whitepaper that put forth compelling reasons why current benchmarking needs to be adjusted by analyzing datasets generated across numerous computers and user workloads.


# Projects

- [uC Interface](https://moleson21.github.io/uC-Interface)
  This is a side project that started out as a testing interface to aid in rapid bring up and prototyping of hardware systems for Berkeley Hyperloop. It was originally used to toggle & read the arduino pins for use with dynamic setups of soleniods on numerous test rigs.

- [Cal AIAA](https://aiaa.berkeley.edu/) [Member 2015-2018]
  The github group for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/cal-roboops).

- [Berkeley Hyperloop](https://berkeleyhyperloop.com/) [Member 2015-2018]
  The github group for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/Berkeley-Hyperloop).

- FPGA RISC-V Softcore
  Developed a state machine processor. Included software implementations for button debouncing, quadrature encoders, aduio chip communication, and UART/I2C/SPI protocols.

- Pintos
  Wrote a simple operating system and priority schedular which Created a multi-threaded simple operating system.

- Compiler
Wrote a compiler for a subset of the python language. The compiler consisted of the following three stages:
  1. Lexer & Parser: Took a source file and produced an abstract syntax tree (AST) utilizing FLEX and BISON
  1. Static Analyzer: Takes the AST from stage 1 as input and performs static correctness checks and annotates with identifier information (indexed declarations and links id & typevar to declarations) before outputing another AST
  1. Code Generation: Takes the AST from stage 2 as input and outputs a C equivalent program (including required libraries) for final compilation and running

- [Crust OS](https://github.com/moleson21/crust-os)
  A basic operating system written in Rust.

- [Air Doodle](https://github.com/williampsmith/air-doodle)

- [Balancing Cube](https://github.com/moleson21/ME135_BalancingCube)

- [Connection Tester](https://github.com/moleson21/connection-tester)

- Secure File Server
  Created a secure file server for storing, sharing, and protecting files.

- Private OwnCloud Server
  Created and hosted a private OwnCloud server using an Ubuntu server running in windows hyper-v.

- Misc Smaller Projects
  - Chess: Created a simple Java chess game with GUI.
  - Datastructures: Wrote
